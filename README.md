# Financial-Data-Analysis
This project focuses on solving a critical business problem: how can data-driven insights improve investment decisions in volatile financial markets? Using historical stock market data, this analysis aims to identify patterns, reduce risk, and support more informed portfolio management strategies.

By leveraging Python, financial APIs, and statistical techniques, the project delivers actionable insights to guide equity investment strategies for individual investors or financial institutions.

🧩 Business Problem
Investors and portfolio managers often face challenges like:

Navigating volatile markets without reliable forecasting tools

Understanding the risk-return profile of different stocks

Timing market entries and exits with precision

This project addresses the question:

"Can historical financial data be used to develop a more reliable, quantitative investment decision-making framework?"
